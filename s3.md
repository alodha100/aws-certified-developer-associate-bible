### Cloudfront

- What is a CDN
  - A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to as user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.

- Key Terminology
  - Edge Location - This is the location where content is cached and can also be written. Separate to an AWS Region / AZ
  - Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. Origins can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53.
  - Distribution - This is the name given the CDN, which consists of a collection of Edge locations
  - Web Distribution - Typically used for Websites
  - RTMP - Used for Media Streaming

- What is Cloudfront
  - Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance.
  - Can be used to optimize performance for users accessing a website backed by S3
  - Amazon CloudFront is optimized to work with other Amazon Web services, like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon Route 53. It also works seamlessly with any non-AWS origin server, which stores the original, definitive versions of your files

- Types of Distribution
  - Web Distribution - Used for Websites, HTTP / HTTPS
  - RTMP Distribution - (Adobe Real Time Messaging Protocol)
    - Used for Media Streaming / Flash multi-media content

- Exam Tips
  - Refer to Key Terminology
  - Edge locations are not just READ only - you can WRITE to them, too. (i.e. PUT an object on to them)
  - CloudFront Edge Locations are utilized by S3 Transfer Acceleration to reduce latency for S3 uploads
  - Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live)
  - You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged

### S3 Performance Optimization

- Remember the 2 main approaches to Performance Optimization for S3:
  - Get-Intensive Workloads - User CloudFront
  - Mixed-Workloads - Avoid sequential key names for your S3 objects. Instead, add a random prefix like a hex hash to the key name to prevent multiple objects from being stored on the same partition.

### S3 Summary

- S3 101
  - Remember that S3 is Object-based: i.e. allows you to upload files
  - Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
  - There is unlimited storage
  - Files are stored in Buckets
  - S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally
  - Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
  - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
  - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
  - S3 Storage Classes / Tiers:
    - S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
    - S3 - IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
    - S3 - One Zone IA; Same as IA. However, data is stored in a single Availability Zone only
    - S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (data that is easily reproducible, such as thumbnails, etc)
    - Glacier - Archived data, where you can wait 3 - 5 hours before accessing
  - Remember the core fundamentals of an S3 object:
    - Key (name)
    - Value (data)
    - Version ID
    - Metadata
    - Sub-resources (used to manage bucket-specific configuration)
      - Bucket Policies, ACLs
      - CORS
      - Transfer Acceleration
  - Object-based storage only (for files)
  - Not suitable to install an operating system on
  - Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code

- S3 Security
  - By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
  - You can set up access control to your buckets using:
    - Bucket Policies - Applied at bucket level
    - Access Control Lists - Applied at an object level
  - S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs, which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. These logs can be written to another bucket
  - Encryption  In Transit:
      - SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
    - At Rest:
      - Server Side Encryption
        - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
        - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys, S3-KMS
        - Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C
    - Client Side Encryption
  - Remember that we can use a Bucket Policy to prevent unencrypted files from being uploaded by using creating a policy which only allows requests which include the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header

- S3 CORS
  - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    - Used to enable cross origin access for your AWS resources
    - e.g S3 hosted website accessing javascript or image files located in another S3 bucket
    - By default resources in one bucket cannot access resources located in another
    - To allow this we need to configure CORS on the bucket being accessed and enable access for the origin (bucket) attempting to access
    - Always use the s3 website URL, not the regular bucket URL
    - S3 website URL: http://acloudguru.s3-website.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
    - Regular Bucket URL: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
